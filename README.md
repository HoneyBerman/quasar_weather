# Quasar Weather App (quasar-weather)

A Quasar Framework Weather app made using UI design with VueJS. It can be written 1 time and can be built for all 5 platforms, Windows,Mac,Android,iOS and Browser for deployment at the same time. Here the app is only built by me for Android as apk file and for browser as vue file which can be used with suitable extensions. You can see the below screenshot for the working.

## Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
quasar dev
```


### Build the app for production
```bash
quasar build
```

### Customize the configuration
See [Configuring quasar.conf.js](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/quasar-conf-js).
